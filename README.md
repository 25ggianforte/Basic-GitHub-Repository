# Project Theme Interests

## General Theme
Using environmental data to look at long term changes in places I am familiar with.

## Interest Statement
I am interested in working with real environmental datasets to see how conditions have changed over time at a local scale. Looking at a single city feels manageable and easier to understand than trying to analyze something global right away.

## Possible Direction
One idea I am considering is using historical temperature data for Cedar Rapids, Iowa to explore whether average temperatures appear to change over time. This is just a starting point and not a final project decision.

## Tools and Skills I Want to Work With
- Real world environmental and climate datasets  
- Simple data analysis and plotting  
- Geospatial or cloud based tools like Google Earth Engine  
- Version control and reproducible workflows using Git and GitHub  

## Status
This is a preliminary description of my interests rather than a finalized project topic. The exact focus will likely change once I explore the data and tools in more detail.
