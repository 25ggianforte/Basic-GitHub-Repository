  <h1>Project Theme Interests</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>General Theme</h2>
    <p>
      Using environmental data to look at long term changes in places I am familiar with.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What I Am Interested In</h2>
    <p>
      I am interested in working with real environmental datasets and learning how to explore
      trends over time at a local scale. Starting with one city feels manageable and makes it
      easier to understand what the data is actually showing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Possible Direction</h2>
    <p>
      One possible direction for this project is looking at historical temperature data for
      Cedar Rapids, Iowa to see how average temperatures may have changed over time. This is
      just an initial idea and not a final project decision.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Tools and Skills I Want to Work With</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Public environmental and climate datasets</li>
      <li>Basic data analysis and plotting</li>
      <li>Geospatial or cloud based tools like Google Earth Engine</li>
      <li>Git and GitHub for organizing files and tracking changes</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>
      This page describes a preliminary theme of interest. The exact topic, data, and methods
      will likely change once I spend more time exploring what is available and what is realistic
      to do this semester.
